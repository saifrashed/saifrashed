        Delta Sport Innovation offers products and services in the field of sports and physical activity. They
        approached me with a request to design, implement, test, and release their Movesense-based mobile athlete
        activity tracking system.
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        After numerous meetings, brainstorming sessions, and calls, we established a shared mental model for the
        solution's design. Movesense sensors can be used across various domains, such as medical, healthcare, and
        fitness. In this particular case, we concentrated on sports and fitness, using relevant formulas, metrics,
        and literature to develop the list of requirements. Once the list was finalized, we continued to the development
        phase.
      </p>

      <h2>App</h2>
      <p>
        Using Flutter, I developed both iOS and Android builds from a single codebase. Based on the requirements, the
        screens were designed and iteratively built. Features were implemented using an agile approach in two-week
        sprints, ensuring the client received a releasable MVP version after each sprint. Typically, sprints are
        conducted with teams using SCRUM, but this approach is equally effective for collaboration between a developer
        and a client, as it organizes the project efficiently.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Movesense offers a plugin for Flutter allowing to client app to connect to the sensors over
        bluetooth, requests to be sent from the client app to the sensors, also subscribe to values recorded by the
        specific metrics. However, there are many caveats in developing for these sensors, and Movesense documents well,
        but doesn't disclose all these issues.
      </p>

      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <p>
        The Movesense documentation contains a diagram showing how the firmware, located on the sensor itself, and the
        client interact. The design of any application on the Movesense platform must take these components, as well as
        Bluetooth transmission, into account.
      </p>

        <img src="./architecture.png" width="100%" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 2:</b> The left-hand side shows the firmware.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The platform allows the underlying base firmware to be updated while keeping the custom-built software intact.
        This is possible due to the use of REST interfaces, which hide any implementation details. The team also made a
        variety of of sample apps showcasing the capabilities of the sensor.
      </p>


      <h2>Let's get in touch</h2>
      <p>
        Having worked with the platform and gone through the process of releasing an app, I can share some useful
        insights. Additionally, I am available for new projects. <a href="mailto:info@oufaska.com" target="_blank">Send
          me an email</a>, and
        let's schedule a call, without obligation.
      </p>
