    <section>
      <p>
        This report outlines my design and implementation of a compiler for CiviC, a C-like language designed by the
        University of Amsterdam for the course Compiler Construction. The focus was on core language features, including
        support for arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and nested functions.

      <h2>Lexicographic and Syntactic Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The process began with lexicographic analysis using Flex to define tokenization rules. Next, I conducted
        syntactic analysis, building grammars for constants, expressions, statements, and function
        definitions. Initial ambiguities and conflicts, particularly with variable declarations, were resolved by
        refining the approach.
      </p>


      <h2>Semantic Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        During semantic analysis, I created a symbol table data structure for type checking and declaration management.
        Traversals captured all declarations while maintaining checks for variable scopes. The symbol table allowed name
        binding through systematic lookups in the symbol table, ensuring all variables were correctly defined and
        accessible.
      </p>

      <h2>Code Generation</h2>
      <p>
        In the code generation phase, I transformed the AST and implemented output strategies in preparation for
        assembly generation. By traversing the
        grammar, I produced assembly code compatible with the CiviCC VM.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Due to strict deadlines and overwhelming work, the importance of planning and prioritization could not
        be understated.
        The project began with improvisation, but once the intuition seeped in, it became systematic, particularly
        during semantic analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were some unresolved challenges, especially with array initialization and function overloading, however
        the project was a success in that it contained the core features, but more importantly provided valuable
        learning experience. The net result is a functional compiler and a solidified understanding of compiler design.
