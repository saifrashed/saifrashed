      <p>
        Writespace is a writing tool designed to improve the learning experience for students in the field of scientific
        writing. With this platform the process of writing and revising assignments, is made more
        engaging, both for teachers and students.
      </p>

      <h2>Kickin' it off</h2>
      <p>
        The goal was to organize ourselves, a diverse team of 11 people, in a functional DevOps team, practicing Agile
        principles.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./people.png" width="100%" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 1:</b> Meet the team</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We decided to divide the team into a front-end and back-end group. There was a Git master who acted as the
        scrum master, along with a lead for the front-end and back-end groups. Each group member was chosen by
        preferences, and leads were chosen according to their experience.
      </p>

        <img src="./team.png" width="100%" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 2:</b> Final team structure</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>
        After deciding on the teams, we continued to the initial brainstorm session, especially since we had only a few
        weeks to build the solution. During this session, we tried to make sense of it all: What do front-end, back-end,
        and DevOps mean, and how do different platforms and technologies fit into this picture? Where do we agree and
        disagree on?
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./brainstorm.png" width="100%" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 3:</b> Brainstorm session</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Gamification</h2>
      <p>
        Writespace gamifies by adding an element of fun and motivation to the learning process. Gamification elements
        are selected from a wide variety of sources. Students
        can earn points, badges, or rewards based on their progress, quality of writing, and adherence to assignment
        guidelines.

      <figure>
        <img src="./screens.png" width="100%" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4:</b> Screens in the app</figcaption>
      </figure>

      This gamified approach encourages healthy competition among students and boosts their engagement and commitment
      to the task.
      </p>

      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>
        Writespace is a writing tool developed to improve the scientific writing experience for students. The platform
        tackles assignment drafting and revision, applying techniques to improve engagement and efficiency for both
        students and teachers.
      </p>

      <h2>Key requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Badge System:</strong> Students earn badges for participation and achievement in writing exercises
          and assignments.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Quizzes:</strong> Writing skill quizzes help students improve and provide
          opportunities
          to earn badges.</li>
        <li><strong>Teacher Interaction:</strong> Teachers grade assignments, provide feedback, and assign badges to
          recognize student progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Canvas Integration:</strong> Writespace integrates with Canvas, ensuring a familiar environment
          for
          students and educators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical architecture</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="./architecture.png" width="100%" />
      </figure>

      <p>The system consists of three main components: client, service, and model. The client fetches data and
        displays
        it in the user interface. The service handles business logic. The model defines the underlying data structure.
      </p>

      <h2>Database Diagram</h2>

      <figure style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="./database.png" width="100%" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        The model primarily follows this entity relationship diagram. Certain elements are excluded, as MongoDB
        allows document storage without separate tables. This structure was used to develop the API and does not include
        Canvas data.
      </p>

      <h2>Deployment Strategy</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="./deployment.png" width="100%" />
      </figure>

      <p>The system requires three servers for deployment: a Node.js server for hosting the Next.js client, a separate
        Express server for the API, and a MongoDB server for the database. Next.js runs a Node.js instance already, so
        why not build the API in there? We decided on a seperate API and reserve Next.js for UI only.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Writespace successfully improves the scientific writing experience by integrating engaging gamification
        elements that motivate students through badges and interactive quizzes. The university concurs, awarding a final
        grade of 9.
