    <section>
      <p>
        In order to manage a high volume of booking requests, an organization has developed a payment-processing
        architecture over time, primarily running on an established mainframe environment. Within this architecture, a
        particular team oversees multiple systems, including one responsible for validating and routing requests to
        different downstream services. One key component of this system handles larger batches of booking requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        These batches are then sent to an external service for further processing. Since that external service is
        managed by a separate team, the testing process can be slow and sometimes inconsistent, due to data constraints
        and the need for cross-team coordination. To address this challenge, a stub has been proposed to replace the
        external service during testing, allowing for faster and more controlled validation of the batch-booking
        functionality. The guiding question is how to implement a stub for isolating the batch-processing system within
        the mainframe environment, without requiring communication with the actual external service.
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer this question, research was undertaken regarding the mainframe technologies, details of the
        batch-processing system, and the nature of data exchange with the external service. Qualitative interviews were
        also conducted with the test and business analysis teams to understand the requirements and motivations. Based
        on these findings, a stub was designed, implemented, and subsequently tested to verify that it can effectively
        simulate all necessary external interactions.
