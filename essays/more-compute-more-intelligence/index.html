    <h1>More compute, more intelligence.</h1>

      <p>
        The AI race between companies is in full swing. XAI is planning to buy millions of Nvidia chips [1]
        and already has built a 200.000 chip data center named Colossus. Another big player is Oracle, that is
        planning to buy 40 billion dollars [2] worth of Nvidia chips for OpenAI's US datacenter. Intriguingly, a
        billion dollars worth of these chips are also being smuggled to China [3], that benefits from acquiring them in
        order to stay in the AI
        race, highlighting the international stakes to be ahead. These GPUs
        efficiently handle massive matrix computations, making them ideal for
        AI training processes. Companies believe they can improve intelligence by throwing more
        computing power at it. This is due to scaling laws [4], where
        larger model size, dataset and more compute predictably leads to
        improved performance. However, Moore’s Law [5], the observation that posits that computing power doubles every
        two years,
        appears to have ended since 2016 [6]. The growth slowdown is largely caused by physical constraints such as
        quantum tunneling [7]. Even ASML states that transistor shrink is slowing [8]. Nvidia's CEO shared this
        sentiment in 2019 [9], saying Moore’s Law is "dead", though in 2025 he claimed AI chips are improving faster
        than Moore’s Law [10]—a
        biased view. One major implication is that we will not achieve higher intelligence
        by simply increasing compute. ASML VP of technology Jos Benschop warns [11] "If we do not improve the power
        efficiency of our AI chips over time,
        the training of the models could consume the entire worldwide energy
        and that could happen around 2035.". So while scaling laws show predictable model performance improvements the
        physical limitations of sheer energy use needed to develop these models might be unsustainable.
