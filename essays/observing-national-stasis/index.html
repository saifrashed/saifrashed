        According to Adriaan Mol, founder of Mollie and MessageBird and worth 3.5 billion dollars [1], as quoted in the
        Parool newspaper [2], he would not start his companies in Amsterdam if given another chance. He added that tech
        companies thrive despite the government, not because of it. In Portugal, the CEO of Cloudflare <a
          href="https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1926895319595245750">stated the following on X</a> when asked about his
        unsatisfaction with Portugal for Cloudflare:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Mostly around immigration. But also permitting. General stifling bureaucracy. And a complete lack of a
        functional airport. Mostly I’m sick of being told things are going to get better if we just invest more only for
        them to continue to trend worse." — Matthew Prince
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        A similar sentiment is echoed by ASML, the world’s largest semiconductor producer, which has threatened to leave
        the Netherlands [3]. This prompted the government to initiate Plan Beethoven [4], a program aimed at increasing
        housing and improving the electricity grid to retain the conglomerate, as it provides the Netherlands with a
        significant position in global politics. The CEO at the time, Peter Wennink, stated that strict immigration
        policies limit the import of talent from abroad, restricting the company’s growth:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “We prefer to do that here, but if we cannot get those people here, we will get those people in Eastern Europe,
        or in Asia, or in the United States.” — Peter Wennink
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Additionally, Reuters reports [5] that ASML cannot guarantee further growth in 2026 due to geopolitical and
        macroeconomic challenges, such as U.S. tariffs set by President Trump, indicating the risks of overdependence on
        the U.S. Restrictions on selling to China [6] also pose challenges for the company, confirming that heavy
        bureaucracy hampers innovation and growth.

        While people eagerly await housing, construction is being delayed by methane gas policies.
        Fundamental problems
        remain unaddressed, and politicians focus on symptoms instead of causes. Migration policy has been blamed for
        civil issues, diverting attention from the fact that the country's global standing is weakening. A generation is
        struggling to move forward, facing cuts in education and rising costs. When the public turns to TV, they witness
        politicians blaming each other and playing political games while real issues persist. This pessimistic mindset,
        viewing others as enemies, is evident in the cabinet and on the streets. Holding different opinions can lead to
        ridicule, even by politicians, prompting the College for Human Rights to state [7] that the freedom of
        expression is under pressure in the Netherlands.

      <p>
        While the importance of rules cannot be understated, excessive regulation can lead to bureaucratic paralysis. A
        collective entrepreneurial mindset requires embracing the risk of failure and embracing a free exchange of
        ideas, all while maintaining a unifying vision for the future. Until Dutch society and its leaders embrace this
        freedom to take risks, we will struggle to progress in an increasingly volatile world.
